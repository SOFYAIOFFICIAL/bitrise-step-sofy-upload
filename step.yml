  Upload your build at Sofy through Bitrise.
  You are required to provide the Build Path and Subcription key.
  You can find your subscription key by logging into Sofy, going to Account Settings --> API Key section.
  Typically this path is generated by a previous build Step in your
  Workflow. For example:
  - The Xcode build for simulator Step generates a .app file at `$BITRISE_APP_DIR_PATH`
  - The Xcode Archive & Export for iOS Step generates a ipa file at `$BITRISE_IPA_PATH`
  - The Android Build Step generates apk file at `$BITRISE_APK_PATH`
